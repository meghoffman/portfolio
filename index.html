      <h2>about Me</h2>
      <p>I have spent many years educating teenagers in nearly every subject. After pushing them to always follow their dreams, I often wondered if I had found my true calling. My passion for programming developed when I was tasked with redesigning our school's website.  Although I needed a CRM to make that happen, a spark was lit. I have been in love with web design ever since. I even designed the coding curriculum I currently teach to Middle School students. Passing on this knowledge has given me some of my most memorable classroom moments.</p>   
      <p>I began my coding journey online with freecodecamp and codacademy. After growing frustrated, I enrolled in the Treehouse Techdegree Program. HTML and CSS were never a problem. It was when I got to JavaScript that I encountered some issues. After many months aboard the struggle bus, I enrolled in General Assembly's JavaScript Bootcamp. This bootcamp gave me my 'ah-ha moment'. Although I still have a lot to learn, my foundation is solid. The projects are from the time I was enrolled and after.</p>
